page - add/edit associations
    add helper text i.e. AACAR | Anne Arundel Association of Realtors

on add_fields
    number fields | on save verify there are two fields for the group

    possibly on other pages too
    change Buyer Name to Buyer/Renter Name


fill_fields.js and anything else with import or const
    add these to app.js
    example from fill_fields.js of what to move from this file to app.js
        import { filter_array, format_number } from '../../global.js';
        const writtenNumber = require('written-number');
        const axios = require('axios');
        import datepicker from 'js-datepicker';
        import { form_elements, select_refresh } from '@/form_elements.js';

on upload file list show first as active in form group list to left


agents - on doc management
    allow them to request credit report if they have their application uploaded


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

on field properties popup
    checkbox and maybe radio
        checkbox/radio input value needs to be moved below Helper text


uploaded files can never be deleted after fields have been added
They just become non-active but still usable in files previously created


remove helper text from address fields on add and fill

maybe have to make all data-div the same h,w,x,y percents as parent field-div for creating pdfs

remove all names from inputs
