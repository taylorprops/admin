!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

on field properties popup
    checkbox and maybe radio
        checkbox/radio input value needs to be moved below Helper text


uploaded files can never be deleted after fields have been added
They just become non-active but still usable in files previously created


remove helper text from address fields on add and fill

maybe have to make all data-div the same h,w,x,y percents as parent field-div for creating pdfs

remove all names from inputs



MAKING PDF LAYERS
exec('pdftk '.$upload_dir.'\pages\page_01.pdf background '.$upload_dir.'\pages\page_02.pdf output '.$upload_dir.'\pages\combined.pdf');
